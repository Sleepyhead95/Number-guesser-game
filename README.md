# Number-Guessing Game

The aim of this project was to create a functional number-guessing game using JavaScript. It is a part of the Codecademy course on JavaScript.
It is my first JS project ever. 
The HTML, CSS, and the more complex JS (game.js) were already provided by Codecademy, while I wrote the functions inside 'script.js' to ensure that the game would do the following:

1. generate a random target number from 0-9
2. create a compare function to determine which guess (either user or computer) is closer to the target number
3. update the winner score by 1
4. update the round level by 1
